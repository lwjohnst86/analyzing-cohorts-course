## Description

*The course description is an opportunity for you to "sell" your course to students! Why is this an important topic? What are some interesting applications? What will they be able to do after taking your course? Here's an example from another course:*

Once you've started learning tools for data manipulation and visualization like dplyr and ggplot2, this course gives you a chance to use them in action on a real dataset. You'll explore the historical voting of the United Nations General Assembly, including analyzing differences in voting between countries, across time, and among international issues. In the process you'll gain more practice with the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, learn about the broom package for tidying model output, and experience the kind of start-to-finish exploratory analysis common in data science.

## Learning objectives

*The learning objectives should be specific and action-oriented. What are the key takeaways from your course? Here are some examples:*

* Learn principles of exploratory data analysis while using a combination of tools
* Practice manipulating data with dplyr and visualizing data with ggplot2
* Be introduced to the broom and tidyr packages for managing multiple tidy models
