- Think about potential exercises
    - how these exerices flow through the course
    - how they are broken up
    - start with hardest/final/end exercise and work backwards
    - only need an overall idea/thought on what the exercise is with basic code
- 3-4 lessons/chapter, 4-5 chapters
- (for now) 2-3 exercises per lesson
    - 2x3x4 = 24 to 3x4x5 = 60 (24-60 exercises)
    - *max* 12 lines of code

- Choose one datasets/chapter for next week.

- Step 3: more exercises for next stage.
