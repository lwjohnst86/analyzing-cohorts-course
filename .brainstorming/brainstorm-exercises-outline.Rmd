# Outline

(other notes/ideas... rather than focus on just disease, or just retrospective,
etc, maybe focus on being able to identify based on data set what questions can 
be asked, and what tests to use based on those questions... and how to focus
on getting the data into the proper form for those tests and how to make the
results meaningful to audience)
So... maybe outline would be:

- Ch1: Intro, general look of data, types of study designs
- Ch1: Research questions able to be asked from data and impact on stats
- Ch2: Wrangling data to get into proper for statistics
- Ch2: Transforming for statistics if necessary
- Ch3: Run statistics on data
- Ch3: Extract results or numbers from model
- Ch4: Backtransform based on what is most meaningful for presenting
- Ch4: Presenting the results in a plot or table

    RunStatistics -> ExtractResults -> BackTransformEtc -> PresentResults

")
