## Lesson 1: Introduction to cohort designs

### Exercise: When can prevalence or incidence be calculated? (maybe... or stick with below..?)

{{MCQ with console or NE?}}

The type of cohort design restricts what you can calculate. Using simple measures
such as `table` or `group_by` with `count`, which of the below responses are accurate?

{{Provide responses with possible numbers of prev/incid? Or just straight NE
to calculate incidence/prevalence?}}

## Lesson 3: Scientific questions that can be asked of cohort data


*Content*
- research questions able to be asked from data and impact on stats
    - retrospective, can ask questions like:
- {{Add more here}}
- types of questions we could ask of Framingham

*Exercises*
- MCQ/text: Given dataset, which questions can be asked based on data.
- MCQ/text: Which question needs which statistic? (hmm maybe not)
- Simpson's paradox? 

### Exercise 1:
Text? MCQ?: Which research question belongs with which dataset?

### Exercise: Here's data and a question, which test to use? (maybe)

Text? or MCQ?: Show example data. Which statistics to use for this?
Or maybe choose which stats belongs with which data type? Or which question
belongs with which data and statistic?

# Extra

- Sources of bias (not at this stage) TODO: move to analysis or wrangling chapter?
- odds ratio, relative risk, incidence rate ratio
    - risk estimate of some type, for instance of diseases that are not binary
    - which questions will need which statistic

{{Need some type of cliff hanger here...}}
