## Why use figures over tables?

STROBE, depends on statistical analysis, when and why not.

- Table or figure? When to use either
    - Above all, try to use a figure. They tend to show results the best,
    quickest, and are more intuitive/understandable then tables.
    - But not all results work in a figure.

We can make this type of plot by using geom point, geom errorbar (the horizontal version), and geom vline. In this case, each item on the y axis is an individual model's predictor and on the x axis is the estimate, as odds ratios, and confidence interval from the model. Since the so called null line is at 1 for odds ratio values, we need to set the xintercept to 1. You may see that for showing many models,
