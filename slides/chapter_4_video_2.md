`@script`

- Table or figure? When to use either
    - Above all, try to use a figure. They tend to show results the best,
    quickest, and are more intuitive/understandable then tables.
    - But not all results work in a figure.
- STROBE guidelines
    - "Report other analyses doneâ€”eg analyses of subgroups and interactions, and
    sensitivity analyses"
