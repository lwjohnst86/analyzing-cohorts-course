*Content*:

+ What it means to "adjust" for confounders? What is a confounder? (probably explained 
in one of the other epi courses, so be brief here).
    + What does adjustment mean when time is included? Gets trickier. This is why
    cross+sectional analyses are simpler analytically.
    + Danger of not controlling for variables: Simpson's Paradox. Can lead to actual
    harm if analyses not thought through and properly analyzed.
    + Techniques to determine what to adjust for (DAG, literature, IC)
    + Model selection (AIC, BIC, Cross-validation{{ya?}}; when to use each)
