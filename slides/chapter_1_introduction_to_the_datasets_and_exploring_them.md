Before getting more into the dataset we will be using, we're going to quickly cover some more differences between prospective and retrospective cohorts. Since the dataset we are using is a prospective cohort, it's a good idea to highlight why a prospective cohort was chosen compared to a retrospective cohort.

Before doing any substantial tidying of the dataset, it's a very wise idea to quickly explore the data to get a sense of its structure, limitations, and strengths.

## Summary of lesson

```yaml
type: FullSlide
```

`@part1`

- General overview of the Framingham Heart Study dataset
- Identified key feature of a cohort (aka a time component!)
- Need to be aware of difference between prospective and retrospective cohort
    - The actual data will often look very similar
    - Need to refer to documentation extensively
- Cohorts allow determining incidence, compared to prevalence
- Need to recognize assumptions and limitations of dataset
