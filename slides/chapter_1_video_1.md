Hi! I'm Luke and I do research in diabetes epidemiology. I will be your
instructor for this course, where we will be going over how to analyze cohort 
datasets. In this chapter, we will be covering some of the basics of what a
cohort is, thoughts about the process of and typical steps involved in analyzing
cohort datasets, and some first steps in looking over the data.

Cohort studies are fundamental to epidemiological research and a key design for answering research questions about human health and behaviour. Cohort studies are especially common in studies on health and disease, as they can be used to identify risk factors for disease that can be targeted in prevention and disease management strategies. They are also incredibly powerful when watching for side effects from new, or old, drugs.

## Two cohort study designs

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 5a578ef6a6
```

`@part1`

#### Prospective

Study participants:

- Don't have the disease
- Looks forward in time:
    - Multiple visits over time
    - Health and other conditions measured at time visit
- Comparison group is determined after disease develops

`@part2`

#### Retrospective

Study participants:

- Have the disease
- Looks back in time:
    - Asked about past conditions
    - ...or past medical health records examined
- Needs a comparison group without the disease

`@script`

There are two cohort study designs: prospective and retrospective. These two designs are very similar except for some key differences.
- Most often, cohorts are used to study a disease state (have or don't have), but sometimes, cohorts are used to study intermediate states before disease occurs, especially if the disease is rare or has a long development history.
- Prospective cohorts are by far the most common and most powerful forms for studying disease states, especially for diseases that are common (e.g. diabetes). Retrospective cohorts are useful with rarer diseases or where health records are easy to access, but they are less common. 

{{In the next video lesson, we will go over more about retrospective vs prospective}}

## Why do you need to know the basics of a what a cohort is?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d2a6af7c52
```

`@part1`

Why learn about what a cohort is? Why not just analyze the data?
- Type of cohort study restricts analysis and interpretation
- Variables measured limits 
- Type of design restricts type of analysis, so need to know the research
question and design

`@script`

The main reason 

There some important differences in how you analyse, interpret, and present
cohort data.

## Main goal of this course

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 5c430ef5dd
```

`@part1`

> **Learn the thought process, general analytic workflow, and main focus of doing and analyzing a cohort study... not to learn a specific statistical method.**

`@script`

{{Not sure if I need this here or if at the course home page will be enough}}

The main goal of this course isn't about specific techniques... Because cohorts
and the data analyses for them are varied and diverse, the statistical
techniques used ranges from simple to fairly complicated. Because of this, it is
difficult to focus a course on analysing cohorts that is specific to a
statistical technique, because this would only apply to specific research
questions and specific cohorts. So instead, the main learning goal is on the
general workflow of cohort data analyses.

## Summary of lesson

`@part1`

- Cohorts:
    - Are a group of people who share a common characteristic or feature 
    - Have a time component to the study
    - Measure some health or disease condition
- Two main cohort designs: prospective and retrospective
- Cohort data analysis is highly diverse
    - Focus on the workflow and process

`@script`

So, let's just quickly review what we've covered so far. We talked about what a
cohort is, the two types of cohorts, what the variables are called, and that
data analysis of cohorts is highly dependent on the research question and
specific setting so we need to focus on the workflow rather than any specific
statistic.
