In this chapter, we will be covering some of the basics of what a cohort is, thoughts about the process of and typical steps involved in analyzing cohort datasets, and some first steps in looking over the data.

- Know that analyzing cohorts is just as much about the process/workflow as it
is about the specific tools/statistics to use.
- Recognize the type of cohort design from the data
- Know which research questions can and cannot be asked of the given data
- Have a general understand of which statistical tests to use for which data and
that the test will dictate how the data should look.
- Know where to look and what resources to use if you can't find the statistical
or analytical techniques needed to analyze the data.

Outline to video:

- What are they, why use them, what do they give.

- Outline of course, focusing on workflow/process

- 
- Cohorts allow determining incidence, compared to prevalence
- Participants are chosen for a reason... they are a specific "group"

## What is a cohort study? The basics

```yaml

```

`@part1`

- A study over time that involves assessing one or more "exposures" (or called a "predictor") to one or more "outcomes".
    - Outcome: The disease or health state (e.g. cancer) that is the focus of the cohort study
    - Exposure/predictor: A variable that is thought to relate to a disease (e.g. tobacco smoking)

## The two main cohort study designs

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 5a578ef6a6
```

`@part1`

#### Prospective

Study participants:

- Don't have the disease
- Looks forward in time:
    - Multiple visits over time
    - Health and other conditions measured at time visit
- Comparison group is determined after disease develops

`@part2`

#### Retrospective

Study participants:

- Have the disease
- Looks back in time:
    - Asked about past conditions
    - ...or past medical health records examined
- Needs a comparison group without the disease

## Need to know some basics of cohorts. Why?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d2a6af7c52
```

`@part1`
Why learn about what a cohort is? Why not just analyze the data?
- Type of cohort study restricts analysis and interpretation
- Variables measured limits 
- Type of design restricts type of analysis, so need to know the research
question and design
