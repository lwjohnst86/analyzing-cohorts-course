In this chapter, we will be covering some of the basics of what a cohort is, thoughts about the process of and typical steps involved in analyzing cohort datasets, and some first steps in looking over the data.

- Know that analyzing cohorts is just as much about the process/workflow as it
is about the specific tools/statistics to use.
- Recognize the type of cohort design from the data
- Know which research questions can and cannot be asked of the given data
- Have a general understand of which statistical tests to use for which data and
that the test will dictate how the data should look.
- Know where to look and what resources to use if you can't find the statistical
or analytical techniques needed to analyze the data.

Outline to lesson:

- What are they, why use them, what do they give.
- Cohorts allow determining incidence, compared to prevalence
- Participants are chosen for a reason... they are a specific "group"

## Main goal of this course

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 5c430ef5dd
```

`@part1`

> **Learn the thought process, general analytic workflow, and main focus of doing and analyzing a cohort study... not to learn a specific statistical method.**

`@script`

{{Not sure if I need this here or if at the course home page will be enough}}

Before getting into what cohorts are, I want to reinforce the goal of this course... Because cohorts and the data analyses for them are varied and diverse, the statistical techniques used ranges from simple to fairly complicated. Because of this, it is difficult to focus a course on analysing cohorts that is specific to a statistical technique, because this would only apply to specific research questions and specific cohorts. So instead, the main learning goal is on the general workflow of cohort data analyses.

## The two main cohort study designs

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 5a578ef6a6
```

`@part1`

#### Prospective

Study participants:

- Don't have the disease
- Looks forward in time:
    - Multiple visits over time
    - Health and other conditions measured at time visit
- Comparison group is determined after disease develops

`@part2`

#### Retrospective

Study participants:

- Have the disease
- Looks back in time:
    - Asked about past conditions
    - ...or past medical health records examined
- Needs a comparison group without the disease

`@script`

{{Include images here?}}

- Most often, cohorts are used to study a disease state (have or don't have), but sometimes, cohorts are used to study intermediate states before disease occurs, especially if the disease is rare or has a long development history.
- Prospective cohorts are by far the most common and most powerful forms for studying disease states, especially for diseases that are common (e.g. diabetes). Retrospective cohorts are useful with rarer diseases or where health records are easy to access, but they are less common. For this reason, we will focus on prospective cohorts.

## What are the main variables of interest called?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: db497d56cf
```

`@part1`

- *Outcome*: 
    - The disease or health state (e.g. cancer)
    - Commonly shown as the $y$ in regression analysis
- *Exposure/predictor*: 
    - Variable hypothesized to relate to a disease (e.g. tobacco smoking)
    - Commonly shown as the $x$ in regression analysis

`@script`

- Every field has their own naming convention for the variables of interest. In the case of cohorts, they are called "outcomes" for the y variable that is commonly seen in statistical notation, and "exposures" or "predictors" for the x variable in statistics.
- Like most data analyses, there is the variable you are interested in "predicting" or identifying risk for, and there is the variables that you think are what "predict" or influence in some way... the exposure to a condition that is thought to cause or to relate to the disease.

## Need to know some basics of cohorts. Why?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d2a6af7c52
```

`@part1`
Why learn about what a cohort is? Why not just analyze the data?
- Type of cohort study restricts analysis and interpretation
- Variables measured limits 
- Type of design restricts type of analysis, so need to know the research
question and design

`@script`

## Summary of lesson

```yaml

`@part1`

- Cohorts are:
    - Group of people who share a common characteristic or feature 
    - Has a time component to the study
    - Measures some health or disease condition
- Two main cohort designs: prospective and retrospective
- Name of variables of interest: outcome and exposure/predictor
- Cohort data analysis is highly diverse
    - Focus on the workflow and process

`@script`

Let's review what we've covered so far. We talked about what a cohort is, the two types of cohorts, what the variables are called, and that data analysis of cohorts is highly dependent on the research question and specific setting so we need to focus on the workflow rather than any specific statistic.
