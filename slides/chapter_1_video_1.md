In this chapter, we will be covering some of the basics of what a cohort is, thoughts about the process of and typical steps involved in analyzing cohort datasets, and some first steps in looking over the data.

- Know that analyzing cohorts is just as much about the process/workflow as it
is about the specific tools/statistics to use.
- Recognize the type of cohort design from the data
- Know which research questions can and cannot be asked of the given data
- Have a general understand of which statistical tests to use for which data and
that the test will dictate how the data should look.
- Know where to look and what resources to use if you can't find the statistical
or analytical techniques needed to analyze the data.

Outline to video:

- What are they, why use them, what do they give.

- Outline of course, focusing on workflow/process

- 
- Cohorts allow determining incidence, compared to prevalence
- Participants are chosen for a reason... they are a specific "group"

## Main goal of this course

```yaml

```

`@part1`

> **Learn the thought process, general analytic workflow, and main focus of doing and analyzing a cohort study... not to learn a specific statistical method.**

`@script`

{{Not sure if I need this here or if at the course home page will be enough}}

Before getting into what cohorts are, I want to reinforce the goal of this course... Because cohorts and the data analyses for them are varied and diverse, the statistical techniques used ranges from simple to fairly complicated. Because of this, it is difficult to focus a course on analysing cohorts that is specific to a statistical technique, because this would only apply to specific research questions and specific cohorts. So instead, the main learning goal is on the general workflow of cohort data analyses.

## The main focus of cohorts for data collection

```yaml
type: FullSlide

```

`@part1`

- Outcome: 
    - The disease or health state (e.g. cancer)
    - Commonly shown as the $y$ in regression analysis
- Exposure/predictor: 
    - Variable thought to relate to a disease (e.g. tobacco smoking)
    - Commonly shown as the $x$ in regression analysis

`@script`

- Like most data analyses, there is the variable you are interested in "predicting" or identifying risk for, and there is the variables that you think are what "predict" or influence in some way... the exposure to a condition that is thought to cause or to relate to the disease.

## The two main cohort study designs

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 5a578ef6a6
```

`@part1`

#### Prospective

Study participants:

- Don't have the disease
- Looks forward in time:
    - Multiple visits over time
    - Health and other conditions measured at time visit
- Comparison group is determined after disease develops

`@part2`

#### Retrospective

Study participants:

- Have the disease
- Looks back in time:
    - Asked about past conditions
    - ...or past medical health records examined
- Needs a comparison group without the disease

## Need to know some basics of cohorts. Why?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d2a6af7c52
```

`@part1`
Why learn about what a cohort is? Why not just analyze the data?
- Type of cohort study restricts analysis and interpretation
- Variables measured limits 
- Type of design restricts type of analysis, so need to know the research
question and design
