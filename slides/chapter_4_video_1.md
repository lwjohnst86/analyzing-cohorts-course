`@script`

- Give careful thought into how to best show results in a understandable and
impactful way for public health professionals and clinicians.
- Emphasize figures over tables, but know when to use either.
- Be cautious in interpreting "non-significant" findings, since they could also
have meaningful clinical implications.
- Use cautious language when presenting results
    - Especially with "causal" language
- Discuss STROBE guidelines in context of longitudinal study.

- Know how to understand and interpret the results (we'll get to knowing what
exactly is most useful to present and show for higher impact) Or move to chapter 4?

Lesson 1: Language and information to use when communicating the findings

- Danger of not showing all results or proper cautious interpretation, because
lives are at risk.
- Highlighting uncertainty and magnitude of results over "statistical significance"
- When to use stronger causal language
    - Depending on magnitude of finding, can use stronger causal language.
    - e.g. with smoking and lung cancer
    - Often argued that only Randomized Controlled Trials or animal/cell experiments 
    can use causal language, but that isn't always true.
    - Bradford Hill criteria (e.g. being smoking and lung cancer)
- Most of the time, your target audience for your results/analysis of cohort
studies is people in public health or government or clinicians... so you really
need to make sure that your results are *understandable* to *them*, not to other
data scientists or statisticians or epidemiologists (though you also need to 
target them).
- Discuss STROBE guidelines in context of longitudinal study.

Keep coming back to this throughout the chapter
