- What to show when using tables
    - Disparate estimates from models or results (e.g. showing results from full 
    model, that includes both discrete and continuous exposures)
- Tables are useful to use to show the data of the figure.
    - Tables more machine readable 
    - (though arguably the data for the figure should be provided with the
    figure)
- This is especially important for meta-analyses done on the topic of your results.
- STROBE: "Cohort studyâ€”Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time"

Outline:
- Why tables are effective forms of communicating results
- When to use them
    - Use as a means of giving raw values for results
- What to include
    - STROBE
- How to create them
    - Carpenter
    - Wrangling and kable/knitr

Notice how the p-value is not included here. When trying to communicate results
that can have health impacts, its important to focus on the important parts ... 
the magnitude of association, not on some arbitrary p-value threshold. The
magnitude is more informative, especially for clinicians and public health
practitioners. This is currently a "controversial" stance and opinion, however, 
it is backed by evidence and fact... fact that the p-value is misused and
misinterpreted. For matters of health, misinterpretation can lead to worse
health, greater disease, and death... the lives of people are on the line.
