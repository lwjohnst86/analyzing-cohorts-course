Sensitivity analyses
    - Example: Studying MS severity with some measures. But some missingness at some time points. During analysis, think about idea that MS during severe periods don't come to clinic, so may have selection bias. But when contact participants, seems they come in when they are healthy, because they don't want to be reminded of having MS and want to enjoy the time.
    - exploring potential sub-hypotheses to test assumptions of models and to
    get better understanding
    - e.g. stratified analysis, models with and without covars to id which is
    impacting results, etc
Simpson's paradox? need to consider subgroup analyses (interactions), especially
for sex and ethnicity. (Expand more here, tho mentioned in lesson 2)
